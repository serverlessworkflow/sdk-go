# Go SDK for Open Workflow

The Go SDK for Open Workflow provides strongly-typed structures for the [Open Workflow specification](https://github.com/open-workflow-specification/specification/blob/v1.0.0/schema/workflow.yaml). It simplifies parsing, validating, and interacting with workflows in Go. Starting from version `v4.0.0`, the SDK also includes a partial reference implementation, allowing users to execute workflows directly within their Go applications.

## Reference Implementation

The SDK provides a partial reference runner to execute your workflows:

### Example: Running a Workflow

Below is a simple YAML workflow that sets a message and then prints it:

```yaml
document:
  dsl: "1.0.0"
  namespace: "examples"
  name: "simple-workflow"
  version: "1.0.0"
do:
  - set:
      message: "Hello from the Open Workflow SDK in Go!"
```

You can execute this workflow using the following Go program:

Example of executing a workflow defined in YAML:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "path/filepath"

    "github.com/open-workflow-specification/sdk-go/v4/impl"
    "github.com/open-workflow-specification/sdk-go/v4/parser"
)

func RunWorkflow(workflowFilePath string, input map[string]interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
    data, err := os.ReadFile(filepath.Clean(workflowFilePath))
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    workflow, err := parser.FromYAMLSource(data)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    runner := impl.NewDefaultRunner(workflow)
    output, err := runner.Run(input)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return output, nil
}

func main() {
    output, err := RunWorkflow("./myworkflow.yaml", map[string]interface{}{"shouldCall": true})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("Workflow completed with output: %v\n", output)
}
```

We love contributions! Our aim is to have a complete implementation to serve as a reference or to become a project on its own to favor the Open Workflow ecosystem.

If you are willing to help, please [file a sub-task](https://github.com/open-workflow-specification/sdk-go/issues/221) in this EPIC describing what you are planning to work on first.

### Known Issues

- **MacOS Issue**: If you encounter `goimports: can't extract issues from gofmt diff output`, resolve it with:

```shell
brew install diffutils
```
