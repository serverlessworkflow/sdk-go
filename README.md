## How to use

Run the following command in the root of your Go's project:

```shell script
$ go get github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-go/v2
```

Your `go.mod` file should be updated to add a dependency from the Serverless Workflow specification.

To use the generated types, import the package in your go file like this:

```go
import "github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-go/v2/model"
```

Then just reference the package in your Go file like `myfunction := model.Function{}`.

### Parsing Serverless Workflow files

Serverless Workflow Specification supports YAML and JSON files for Workflow definitions.
To transform such files into a Go data structure, use:

```go
package sw

import (
    "github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-go/v2/model"
    "github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-go/v2/parser"
)

func ParseWorkflow(filePath string) (*model.Workflow, error) {
    workflow, err := parser.FromFile(filePath)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    } 
    return workflow, nil
} 
```

The `Workflow` structure then can be used in your application.
